# Documentation Validation

Use this skill to run the documentation checks selected by the project workflow. The goal is to execute the relevant Deno checks, fix deterministic failures, and report the result clearly. Validation selection remains owned by [.github/instructions/ext-ousia-workflow.instructions.md](../../instructions/ext-ousia-workflow.instructions.md); this skill owns the checker commands and checker implementation boundaries.

Run Deno tasks from the skill directory so the checker uses the bundled scripts with a project-owned documentation config:

```sh
deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation <task>
```

The checker is configuration-driven. Each documentation project owns its structure config; in this repository, that file is [design/check-docs.config.json](../../../design/check-docs.config.json). Keep document roots, numbered-file patterns, directory sequence rules, target documents, and section-reference patterns there; change TypeScript only when the checker needs a new class of rule.

```sh
deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation check:docs --config ../../../design/check-docs.config.json
```

## Procedure

1. Inspect the changed files with `git diff --name-only` and, when needed, `git diff --cached --name-only`.
2. Use the completion-check matrix in [.github/instructions/ext-ousia-workflow.instructions.md](../../instructions/ext-ousia-workflow.instructions.md) to decide which documentation checks apply to those changed files.
3. Run only the selected checks.
4. If a deterministic check fails, fix the cause and rerun the affected check.
5. In the final response, list the changed surfaces and every check that was run with its result.

## Common Commands

- `deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation fmt:docs-checker --check`
- `deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation check:types`
- `deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation lint:docs-checker`
- `deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation test:docs`
- `deno task --cwd .github/skills/doc-validation check:docs --config ../../../design/check-docs.config.json`

## Documentation Hygiene

The Deno checker lives in [scripts/check-docs.ts](./scripts/check-docs.ts) and uses Deno standard library modules for path handling, argument parsing, and filesystem walking. It validates the document tree configured by [design/check-docs.config.json](../../../design/check-docs.config.json). It checks:

- Markdown links resolve.
- Link text that looks like a Markdown filename matches the actual target filename.
- Numbered Markdown files have H1 numbers matching their filename prefix.
- Numbered Markdown files are continuous within each directory that contains numbered Markdown files.
- Bare `NN-*.md` references point to real current Markdown files.
- `target.md §x.y` references point to sections that actually exist in `design/target.md`.

Do not replace checker failures with one-off allowlists unless the allowlist encodes a real documented exception.

Prefer configuration changes over checker code changes when document roots, numbered patterns, directory filters, target documents, or section-reference patterns move. Change TypeScript only when the checker needs a new class of rule.

## Implementation Boundaries

- [scripts/check-docs.ts](./scripts/check-docs.ts) is only the CLI boundary: parse arguments, load config, print diagnostics, and choose the exit code.
- [scripts/check-docs-lib.ts](./scripts/check-docs-lib.ts) is the public library boundary: normalize config, read the document tree, run configured rules, and return a result.
- [scripts/config.ts](./scripts/config.ts) owns config types, defaults, loading, and normalization.
- [scripts/document-tree.ts](./scripts/document-tree.ts) owns filesystem traversal and path normalization.
- [scripts/rules.ts](./scripts/rules.ts) owns validation rules. Rules consume the scanned document tree and normalized config; they should not perform broad filesystem traversal.
- [scripts/diagnostics.ts](./scripts/diagnostics.ts) owns diagnostic collection and output formatting.

Keep project data out of the TypeScript implementation. Repository-specific paths, filename patterns, directory filters, and section-reference patterns belong in the documentation project's config file.
